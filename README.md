Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser And It's Amount Check System
This Project Is very Simple, We Are Using ---

UltraSonic Sensor Module  x2
Arduino UNO               x1
Water Pump                x1
Buzzer                    x1
5V Relay Module           x1
Battery Pack              5V Dc & AC according to Pump

One Ultrasonic Sensor Will Check If Any Hand Nearby and then Turn on Pump To Push Sanitizer
Another Ultrasonic Sensor Will Check Sanitizer Level In Storage Container And Warn About Low Storage Amount

Ultrasonic Sensor for CHECKING HAND- Pin :
 
                                         TRIG : PIN 5
                                         ECHO : PIN 4

Ultrasonic Sensor for CHECKING SANITIZER- Pin :
 
                                         TRIG : PIN 2
                                         ECHO : PIN 3

                                        Relay Pin  : PIN 6 
                                        Buzzer Pin : PIN 7
